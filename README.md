# About

1. It's a ChatGPT clone

2. Since ChatGPT is all over the internet now days, I thought I should
   create a clone of it to learn more about it, how it works and
   obviously to sharpen in development skills.

3. I've set the results to ~50 words (max_tokens) to prevent the abuse.

4. If you like this project, Kindly DM me on twitter and let me know
   your thoughts.
   
# Rules to use 

 Please! Don't abuse the AI by asking too much questions. Since it's
 a sample project, I have limited credits of API. So, Kindly consider
 it and feel free to give a test drive.
